# WhatsApp Clone üöÄ

This project is a full-stack clone of the WhatsApp Web interface, built with Next.js and Node.js. It is designed to simulate real-time chat conversations by processing and displaying chat data from simulated webhook payloads, featuring a responsive UI and a backend API to manage conversations and messages.

##  Live Demo Links

* **Frontend Application:** **[https://whatsapp-clone-frontend-ud4o.onrender.com/](https://whatsapp-clone-frontend-ud4o.onrender.com/)**
* **Backend API:** **[https://whatsapp-clone-backend-d9wf.onrender.com/](https://whatsapp-clone-backend-d9wf.onrender.com/)**

*(Note: The free-tier services on Render may "spin down" after a period of inactivity. The first load might take 30-60 seconds to wake the servers up.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Installation

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MrudulAhirrao/whatsapp-clone.git]
    cd whatsapp-clone
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory: `cd apps/backend`
    * Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string:
        ```env
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        ```
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Populate the database with the sample data: `node populateDb.js`

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd apps/frontend`
    * Create a `.env.local` file to point to your local backend server:
        ```env
        http://localhost:8000
        ```
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`

4.  **Run Both Servers:**
    * In one terminal, start the backend server (from `apps/backend`):
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * In a second terminal, start the frontend server (from `apps/frontend`):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is deployed on **Render** using a two-service monorepo setup.

* The **backend** is a Node.js Web Service pointing to the `apps/backend` root directory. It uses the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
* The **frontend** is a Node.js Web Service pointing to the `apps/frontend` root directory. It connects to the live backend via the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.
